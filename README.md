# ShepherdRover

## Licensing

This repository follows a **hybrid licensing model**:

- **Open-Source Components:**  
  The **base ShepherdRover code**, including the ROS2 navigation stack, core firmware, BOM, and CAD/mechanical designs, are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).  
  This means you can freely use, modify, and distribute these components for both personal and commercial use, provided proper attribution is given.

- **Proprietary Components:**  
  Certain modules — such as the **Farmhand AI integration layer**, **Gemma 3n-powered perception models**, and **enterprise fleet management features** — are **not included in this open-source license**.  
  These are available under a separate commercial agreement.

### Why a Hybrid Model?
We believe in empowering the robotics and farming communities by open-sourcing core hardware and navigation tools, while protecting our proprietary AI reasoning layer to support future sustainability of the project.

### Contributing
We welcome contributions to the open-source components of ShepherdRover! See the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](./CLA.md) for details.
